# Process Payments with Stripe

This is a Go backend service that handles payment processing using Stripe. The service provides a RESTful API built with Gin framework and uses MongoDB for data storage.

This project was created as part of a YouTube tutorial series. You can follow along with the video to understand the implementation details and concepts behind the payment processing system.
